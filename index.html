                        A <strong>croissant</strong> is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
                        shape of the
                        <em>Austrian kipferl</em>, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
                        <strong>Croissants</strong> are
                        named for
                        their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with
                        butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
                        technique called laminating.
                        The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

                Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
                antiquity, but using brioche dough. <em>Kipferls</em> have long been a staple of Austrian, and French
                bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern <strong>croissant</strong> was developed in the early 20th century
                when French
                bakers replaced the brioche dough of the <em>kipferl</em> with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the
                late 1970s, the development of
                factory-made, frozen, preformed, but unbaked dough, made them into a fast food that could be freshly
                baked
                by unskilled labor.
                The <strong>croissant</strong> bakery, was a French response to American-style fast food.
